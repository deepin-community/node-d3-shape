Description: Graphical primitives for visualization, such as lines and areas
 Visualizations typically consist of discrete graphical marks, such as symbols,
 arcs, lines and areas. While the rectangles of a bar chart may be easy enough
 to generate directly using SVG or Canvas, other shapes are complex, such as
 rounded annular sectors and centripetal Catmullâ€“Rom splines.
 .
 This module provides a variety of shape generators for your convenience.

 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
